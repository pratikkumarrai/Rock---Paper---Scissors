# 1. Introduction

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors Game developed using Python and Tkinter. It allows a player to choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors and play against the computer. The interface is beginner-friendly and designed to help learn GUI development and basic game logic.

# 2. Main Objectives

â€¢	Create an interactive GUI-based game.

â€¢	Use Pythonâ€™s tkinter library for the interface.

â€¢	Practice implementing decision-making logic in games.

â€¢	Randomize computer moves using the random module

# 3. Software & Tools Used

â€¢	Python 3.x

â€¢	Tkinter (built-in GUI library in Python)

â€¢	random (built-in module for computer choice logic)

â€¢	IDE/Text Editor: VS Code / PyCharm / IDLE / Any of your choice

# 4. System Design

â€¢	GUI Layout:
 
 o	Title Label

 o	Three Buttons: Rock, Paper, Scissors
 
 o	Result Display Label

â€¢	Logic Layer:


 o User input is handled by button clicks.
 
 o Computer randomly selects a choice.
 
 o	Game logic compares both choices and displays the result.

# 5. Functionalities Implemented

â€¢	Graphical interface with buttons.

â€¢	Randomized computer opponent.

â€¢	Real-time result display after each move

# 6. Workflow

1.	User launches the GUI app.

2.	User selects either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

3.	The computer randomly picks one of the three options.

4.	The result is evaluated and displayed instantly.

# 7. ðŸ’¡ Sample Input/Output

âž¤ User clicks: Rock

âž¤ Computer chooses: Scissors

â†’ Output: "Your choice: Rock

Computer's choice: Scissors

You Win!"

# 8. Advantages

â€¢	Beginner-friendly and easy to understand.

â€¢	No external libraries required.

â€¢	Interactive and fun to play.

â€¢	Enhances understanding of event handling and GUI components.

# 9. Limitations

â€¢	No score tracking or match history.

â€¢	Limited to one round at a time.

â€¢	No difficulty level or multiplayer mode

# 10. Future Enhancements

â€¢	Add score counter for player and computer.

â€¢	Introduce multiple rounds with a scoreboard.

â€¢	Add animations or images for better visual appeal.

â€¢	Create a restart or reset button.

â€¢	Implement sound effects for interaction feedback

# 11. Conclusion

This project demonstrates a foundational use of Python GUI development using tkinter. It's a fun and educational way to practice Python, especially for beginners interested in game development or event-driven 
programming.
